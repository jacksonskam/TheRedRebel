    <p> Letterboxd saw this one first :p.</p>
    
    <p> I think my views on this movie were summed up when I was confused as to why the entire theatre laughed at that kid's dad using the r-slur towards him after he had just described the structural and systemic issues that minorities face in the West. This is just a centrist cope of a movie, continuing to spew the pro-status quo rhetoric of "hey guys look at this, both sides are bad!".</p>
    
    <p> Aster points the finger at one side (where a select few might be performative but are at least fighting for a more equitable society by pointing out how our current socioeconomic system exploits people along racial, class and gender lines) and says haha these people are so silly aren't they, then points his finger at the side (who is literally the epitome of the current system fighting to protect capital rather than human lives) and says both of these guys are stupid and silly and it is because of them that we are feeling so bad today.</p>
    
    <p> Also regarding the weird depiction of Antifa as this clandestine shadowy organization who want to kill everyone just to incite violence is just so disappointing. It speaks a lot about a person who would chose to demonize an organization who's goal is to make sure LITERAL FASCISTS (who, might I add, are the worst fucking people to ever exist) do not gain power. In fact, it has been proven that during the 2020 George Floyd Protests it was fascist organizations who infiltrated Antifa and tried to incite violence in order to provoke law enforcement to use weapons against lawful protesters. So I think we can all understand who the actual bad guys are here, but clearly Ari ASSter cannot.</p>

    <p>Aster needs to get off of his performative high horses and actually make real societal critique that analyzes how our hyper-capitalist system that promotes profit over any kind of humanity just might be the root cause of these deep societal divides that were accelerated during COVID.</p>

    <p>Anyways, fuck the police</p>
