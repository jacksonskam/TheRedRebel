    <p>Red Rebel is my choice of an internet name for this page and my works that I wish to share publically. Red Rebel comes from my passion in fighting for a better society, one that assures the true freedom and liberty for all people, especially those facing the most oppression in our modern society. I believe that socialism from below is the only path forward to this kind of society and that the self-emancipation of the working class (including those in which the capitalist system keeps unemployed in order to increase "competition") is the only way to achieve this kind of society. Thus, Red Rebel came to me as a fitting name for my pursuits of communism which is rooted in historical tradition (red being the historical colour of proletariat struggle) and in the application of socialist thought to the conditions of captialism in the modern day (to rebel being the act of currently rebelling against an exploitative and oppressive system).</p>
    <p>In recent years, the term "rebel" has been taken over my far-right extremists who have come to the misguided conclusion that the "woke left" is imposing authoritarian governmental policy against white men and thus they have taken it upon themselves to "rebel" against this "oppression." I condemn this misappropriation of the term rebel, and I use it instead in its historical usage of those who have actually sought to fight against their own oppressions by the systems that have been put in place to exploit them. This includes rebels against monarchical rule during the French Revoution, rebels against French colonialism during the Haitain Revolution, rebels against labour exploitation during the Paris Commune, rebels against slavery during the American Civil War, rebels against homophobic and transphobic societal structures throughout history and rebels against genocide. You cannot truly be a rebel if the society you seek to put in place continues to exploit and oppress others. You can only be a rebel if you believe that there is a better society for all that is worth fighting for.</p>
